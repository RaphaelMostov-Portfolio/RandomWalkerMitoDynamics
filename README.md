# RandomWalkerMitoDynamics
This repository contains the code I have made public for a research project actively being worked on.

Here is a description of each file:

  - _/doc_
    - detailed info on mitochondria graphs, and the mathematical framework used to program the simulations
  - _/dat_
    - instructions on how to download and read the data set used for this project. 
  - _RandomWalkerModule.py_
    - code used to simulate the random walks
  - _Random_Walker_Module.ipynb_ 
    - test bed and demonstration of the random walker code.
  - _Experiment1.ipynb_
    - preliminary test of the constraints placed on the size of the mitochondria graphs, and the possible use of degree ratio as a test statistic.
